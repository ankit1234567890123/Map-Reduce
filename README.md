## Problem Statement
>>Compute the weight trend over a few years for different states along genders using the given data. For each of the following states, calculate average weight of males and females for each year and plot on a graph with year as the X-axis and avg. weight as the Y-axis. Note that this can be done for all states as well as in other ways. I have chosen 7 states to compare these trends: I) California, ii) Colorado, iii) North Dakota, iv) Texas, v) New York, vi) Maine, and vii) Florida.
